                    <h1>Mocap in Movies</h1>
                    <p>Many movies utilize mocap to create their action-packed adventures. Since none of us can be born with superpowers, a computer is the next best thing.
                        Actors wear suits with markers that reflect infrared light to cameras. These suits make data points for animators to make character models.
                        For example, in the hit <i>Avatar</i> movies, Cameron added small cameras rigged to the helmet to solely capture facial expressions in a 
                        method called performance capture, the process of recording an actor doing the motions of the soon-to-be animated character.</p> 
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px; border-bottom: 2.5px solid #3a2e21;">Performance capture assists the animators by giving them a model to work off of and make the design as realistic as possible.
                        Virtual cameras render actors as virtual characters and the environment in real time with the usage of the swing camera, 
                        a piece of technology Cameron created for his otherworldly movie creations.</p>

                            <h1>Mocap in Video Games</h1>
                            <p>The use of motion capture in video games is similar to the movies. Motion capture technology can also work through a markerless method, 
                                where the animators instead rely on depth-sensitive cameras to track the actor's movements, 
                                along with extra software compared to that needed for marker-based methods.
                                Despite the extra software, the markerless method is often seen as a more convenient method, 
                                though it is generally not as accurate, especially for fine movements. Titles such as <i>Detroit Become Human</i>, <i>The Last of Us</i>, or <i>God of War</i> use motion capture to 
                            create their character models. <i>Detroit Become Human</i> used the actor's physical traits to render the animated character, while <i>God of War</i>
                        used mocap to create a character based on the actor's size. </p>
