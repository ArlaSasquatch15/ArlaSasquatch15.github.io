                <h1>Mocap in Health</h1>
                    
                    <p>Mocap was originally designed to be used in clinical treatment. Mocap is used by doctors and therapists to help diagnose and treat their patients. 
                        Medical professionals use motion capture to improve the quality of life for patients with a variety of both physical and psychological ailments and disabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mocap captures information on things such as joint angles, axle symmetries, accelerations, and joint stress. 
                        This data can then be compared with standard biomedical values to help identify orthopedic dysfunctions. 
                        motion tracking technology helps Physical Therapists visualize the movements of a patient in order to assess their individual needs, 
                        and ensure that patients are using the proper technique during treatment exercises.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Mocap can be used to prevent injury before it happens. The technology has become more prevalent in athletics, 
                        as it can analyze the performance of an athlete to ensure they are using the correct form.
                        Mocap technology can be used to identify movements that can lead to chronic injuries over time. Risk of injuries such as tendonitis 
                        or arthritis can be lessened through the use of motion capture. Mocap combined with virtual reality is also used by military 
                        researchers to assess and treat the injuries of military personnel.</p>
