                <h1>Mocap in Sports</h1>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 10px; ">Sports science research uses inertial motion capture technology that combines an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a magnetometer. 
                    This helps the athlete know how they can go the extra mile and become the best of the best at their sport. 
                    From the coach's perspective, motion capture helps them come up with better strategies on how to position 
                    players on the field based on their strengths and weaknesses to achieve the best results.</p> 
                
                <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The company Australian startup VR Motion Learning has created a VR tennis application 
                    called Tennis Esports that will be capable of tracking players' movements and giving them feedback on how they can improve their performance.
                    Mocap sensors installed on footwear can give coaches insight on how an athlete's skills can be improved, 
                    what their risk of injuries looks like, and how to accelerate recovery speed in case of injury.</p>
               
                <p>3D sports motion capture utilizes marker systems and marker-less systems.
                    Markerless systems currently provide far less information compared to the alternative.
                    Biomechanists who want to study how athletes move, medical professionals who want to understand why athletes are getting injured,
                    and performance coaches who want to know what movements contribute to success use mocap technology.
                    The data collected from mocap is often paired with other quantitative measures such as kinetic data, 
                    however, it plays a siginificant role in the management of players.</p>
