                    <h1>Mocap in Movies</h1>
                    <p>Many movies utilize mocap to create their action-packed adventures. Since none of us can be born with superpowers, a computer is the next best thing.
                        Actors wear suits with markers that reflect infrared light to cameras. These suits make data points for animators to make character models.
                        For example, in the hit Avatar movies, Cameron added small camera rigged to helmet to solely capture facial expressions in a 
                        method called performance capture. Peformance capture is the process of recording an actor doing the motions of the soon-to-be animated character.</p> 
                    <p style="padding-bottom: 50px; border-bottom: 2.5px solid #3a2e21;">The performance capture assists the animators by giving them a model to work off of and make the design as realistic as possible.
                        Virtual camera renders actors as virtual characters and environment in real time with the usage of the swing camera, 
                        a piece of technology Cameron created for his otherworldly movie creations.</p>

                            <p>Motion capture technology can also work through a markerless method, 
                                where the animators instead rely on depth-sensitive cameras to track the actor's movements, 
                                along with extra software compared to that needed for marker-based methods.
                                Despite the extra software, the markerless method is often seen as a more convenient method, 
                                though it is generally not as accurate, especially for fine movements.</p>
