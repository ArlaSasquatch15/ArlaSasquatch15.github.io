                    <h1>Before Mo-Cap</h1>
                        <p>Before mocap, animators used rotoscoping, a process which recorded actors as if live action for animators to use footage. 
                            Compared to hand-drawing everything, rotoscoping siginificantly sped up the animation process.
                            The process allowed filmmakers to develpo complex action scenes and add other-wise impossible features to live-action films.
                            Filmmakers used rotoscoping to extract an element from a specific scene and place it on a different background.</p> 
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px; border-bottom: 2.5px solid #3a2e21;">That footage is projected onto an animation table and traced frame-by-frame on animation cells that were photographed frame-by-frame to create animation.
                            Films such as George Lucas' "Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope" used rotoscoping to create the lightsabers. 
                            Artists used rotoscoping to give the lightsabers their unique light effect.
                            When the technique was adopted by Walt Disney, founder of the entertainment industry Disney, 
                            he used rotoscoping to get a sense of the character's movement and facial expressions rather than simply tracing over live-action footage.
                            This technique was used in the animated films "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves" and "Alice in Wonderland". 
                            The studio also rotoscoped past animations in evidence of the efficiency of the tecnique compared to the old days of hand-drawing every frame.</p>

                    <h1>Mo-Cap Improvements</h1>
                        <p>Mocap captures the characteristics of a physical system's dynamic motion from video, regardless of rendering configuration or image differences.
                            The system sees how differences in rendering can affect texture, light, and background.</p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 50px; border-bottom: 2.5px solid #3a2e21;">One such innovation is the trained neural network pipe devloped by researchers from MIT and IBM, created to avoids this issue, 
                            with the ability to infer the state of the environment and the actions happening, the physical characteristics of the object 
                            or person of interest (system), and its control parameters. Their methodology allows for imitation learning in predicting and 
                            reproducing the trajectory of real-world objects from video.
                            </p>
                    <h1>Mo-Cap Future</h1>
                        <p>The next leap forward for motion capture is the creation of truly 'flip the switch' systems, according to Oxford Metrics. 
                            These systems, made possible through optical and inertial trackers, artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
                            can be turned on and work instantly, without the need for calibration of motion capture markers.</p>
